Implementation of several OAuth2 flows to get access tokens. See https://medium.com/@ernestocullen/oauth2-openid-connect-b5c0cb0fa24e for details.

* AuthServer: Duende Identity Server (https://duendesoftware.com) with clients configured for these examples and also examples in [https://github.com/mcgilbertus/contacts-fapi/](https://github.com/mcgilbertus/contacts-fapi/tree/main/oauth2).
